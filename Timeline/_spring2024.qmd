## Spring 2024: Capstone Project & Full MS

In January, I will be taking the capstone course to acquire the full **MS in Scientific & Technical Communication** degree. This capstone class will be my only class for the semester (down from 3 classes currently) and will be completed by May 2024. It is a project-based course that will let me carry out any real-world project with the input of several professors and masterâ€™s students. This course will essentially be **free, high-end, project-based labor** for whatever company I am working for between January and May of 2024. If I were to be working for the Phipps, I could focus these efforts on anything from a full-scale usability study of thephipps.org website to a unification of branding and documentation or anything else the board or administration might come up with.
