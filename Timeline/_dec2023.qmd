## December 2023: Completion of Master’s Certificate

In December 2023, I will have completed the **Technical Communication Master’s Certificate**, which will be added to my official resume. 

In addition, throughout this fall, **I will be seeking employment full-time for January**. December marks the end of my time as a full-time master’s student, as I will only have the final capstone project to complete in the spring. My preference is to continue working for the Phipps either full-time or part-time while having another part-time job in technical communication. But if my proposed plan or a semblance of it cannot be put into action, I will need to seek full-time employment elsewhere.
