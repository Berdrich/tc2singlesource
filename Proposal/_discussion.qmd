This competitive payment model ensures my ability to work at the Phipps for many years to come. I left the teaching field because my wife is also a teacher, and ultimately, due to inflation and the incredibly expensive housing market, I realized that two teacher salaries were not remotely enough to sustain our lifestyle and provide for our now newborn son, Peregrine. I decided to acquire my master’s degree for the sole purpose of having a significantly higher salary than what a teacher can acquire. As I look to work full-time in January, these are dollar amounts that I will be looking for in my field; technical writers, information designers, and user experience designers make an average of $80,000 to $120,000 annually. Though this dollar amount may seem high, I urge you to review what we are currently spending on contracted designers, that can often charge between $60–100 per hour, significantly higher than my rate.
