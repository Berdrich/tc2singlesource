## Closing Remarks

If the Phipps is unable to meet this higher compensation model, I will completely understand, but I will need to pursue other full-time work come January. Ultimately, I love the Phipps. This organization raised me, and I owe it a lot of credit for bringing me to the place I am today. However, providing for my family takes precedence to my emotional care and affection for the Phipps. Therefore, if this Phipps cannot meet this model, I will have to part ways, but I will part with love! 

I am more than happy to negotiate and answer any questions or concerns you may have. Please feel free to contact me at digitalmarketing@thephipps.org or on my cell at 715.410.9109.
