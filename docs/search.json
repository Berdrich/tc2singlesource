December marks the end of my time as a full-time master’s student, as I will only have the final capstone project to complete in the spring. My preference is to continue working for the Phipps either full-time or part-time while having another part-time job in technical communication.

It is a project-based course that will let me carry out any real-world project with the input of several professors and master’s students. This course will essentially be free, high-end, project-based labor for whatever company I am working for between January and May of 2024. If I were to be working for the Phipps, I could focus these efforts on anything from a full-scale usability study of thephipps.org website to a unification of branding and documentation or anything else the board or administration might come up with."

    "text": "Discussion\nThis competitive payment model ensures my ability to work at the Phipps for many years to come. I left the teaching field because my wife is also a teacher, and ultimately, due to inflation and the incredibly expensive housing market, I realized that two teacher salaries were not remotely enough to sustain our lifestyle and provide for our now newborn son, Peregrine. I decided to acquire my master’s degree for the sole purpose of having a significantly higher salary than what a teacher can acquire. As I look to work full-time in January, these are dollar amounts that I will be looking for in my field; technical writers, information designers, and user experience designers make an average of $80,000 to $120,000 annually. Though this dollar amount may seem high, I urge you to review what we are currently spending on contracted designers, that can often charge between $60–100 per hour, significantly higher than my rate."

However, providing for my family takes precedence to my emotional care and affection for the Phipps. Therefore, if this Phipps cannot meet this model, I will have to part ways, but I will part with love!\nI am more than happy to negotiate and answer any questions or concerns you may have.
